In this section, we embark on crafting a series of projects, serving as practical examples to illustrate the development flow with Lambda Forge. These projects will be introduced incrementally, coexisting within a single repository.

This incremental approach ensures that once a service is introduced in a previous project, it won't be reinitialized in subsequent ones. Instead, we will seamlessly build upon the foundation laid by preceding projects, adding new components and functionalities as we progress.

With this understanding, let's initiate a new project and dive into coding!

```
forge project lambda-forge-examples --repo-owner "$GITHUB-OWNER" --repo-name "$GITHUB-REPO" --bucket "$S3-BUCKET"
```
