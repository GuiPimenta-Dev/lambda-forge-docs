# CI/CD Pipelines and Multi-Stage Environments

#### Customizing Pipeline Steps

In Lambda Forge, pipelines are defined within their specific stack files located at `infra/stacks/dev_stack.py`, `infra/stacks/staging_stack.py`, and `infra/stacks/prod_stack.py`. Below is an outline of the default steps included in each pipeline, along with details on how they function and how you can interact with them.

- **Coverage**: Measures the percentage of your production code covered by unit tests, failing if coverage falls below 80% as default. To view the coverage report, navigate to `Details -> Reports` in CodePipeline.

- **Unit Tests**: Runs unit tests to validate the functionality of individual components within your code. Access the unit test report via `Details -> Reports` in CodePipeline.

- **Validate Docs**: Verifies that all Lambda functions invoked by API Gateway have their Input and Output data classes correctly defined in the `main.py` file.

- **Validate Integration Tests**: This step ensures that all endpoints triggered by the API Gateway are covered by at least one integration test. To achieve this, use the custom decorator `@pytest.mark.integration` and specify the method and endpoint arguments to declare that the test covers a specific endpoint.

- **Generate Docs**: Automatically produces Swagger documentation for all API Gateway endpoints. This requires `Input` and `Output` data classes for each Lambda function in the `main.py` file. Documentation is deployed directly to API Gateway and is accessible at the `/docs` endpoint.

- **Integration Tests**: Performs integration testing to assess the system's overall functionality. Access the integration test report through `Details -> Reports` in CodePipeline.

Lambda Forge provides a suggested pipeline configuration, emphasizing flexibility in its design. You're encouraged to customize these pipelines to fit your project's needs. Whether adding new steps, adjusting existing ones, reordering or even removing them. The framework is designed to accommodate your project's specific requirements. This level of customization ensures that your pipelines align closely with your development, testing, and deployment strategies, providing a robust foundation for your application's continuous integration and delivery processes.

After the pipelines have executed, you may notice that while the Development pipeline succeeds, the Staging and Production pipelines fail.

This failure is expected, It occurs because the integration test step attempts to send a GET request to the deployed Lambda function. However, since the Stack has just been created, the Lambda function's URL is not yet available, causing the test to fail.

```python title="functions/hello_world/integration.py"
import pytest
import requests
from lambda_forge.constants import BASE_URL

@pytest.mark.integration(method="GET", endpoint="/hello_world")
def test_hello_world_status_code_is_200():

    response = requests.get(url=f"{BASE_URL}/hello_world")

    assert response.status_code == 200
```

### Accessing Your Lambda Function

Note that the `Integration_Test` step failed **after** the deployment in the staging pipeline.

This means that both Dev and the Staging Lambda function are successfully deployed.

In this tutorial, we will use the staging URL to test our endpoints, considering it as a pre-production layer. Feel free to utilize the development URL instead if it suits your case better.

Navigate to the AWS Lambda section on AWS and search for the **Staging-Lambda-Forge-Demo-HelloWorld** function in the list of Lambda functions.

Once you've found your function, click on it to view its details. Proceed by selecting the Configuration tab, followed by Triggers to uncover the integration points.

In this tutorial, the generated URL is:

[https://8kwcovaj0f.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/staging/hello_world](https://8kwcovaj0f.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/staging/hello_world).

By following the link provided, you should be greeted by a simple "Hello World" message in your web browser, indicating that your Lambda function is operational and accessible via the URL generated by API Gateway.

```json
{
  "message": "Hello World!"
}
```

### Configuring the BASE URL for Integration Tests

With the Lambda function's URL at hand, we identify that the segment before `/hello_world` acts as the BASE URL. For the purposes of this tutorial, the BASE URL is `https://8kwcovaj0f.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/staging`. This is the URL you need to copy.

**Proceed to incorporate this URL into your project's configuration by setting it as the value for `base_url` in your `cdk.json` file**.

```{.json title="cdk.json" hl_lines=11 linenums=40}
...
"region": "us-east-2",
"account": "",
"name": "Lambda-Forge-Demo",
"repo": {
    "owner": "$GITHUB-USER",
    "name": "$GITHUB-REPO"
},
"bucket": "",
"coverage": 80,
"base_url": "https://8kwcovaj0f.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/staging"
...
```

### Pushing Updated Code to GitHub

With the BASE URL configured for our integration tests, it's time to push the updated code to GitHub and aim for successful integration test outcomes across all deployment stages.

Follow these steps to commit your changes and deploy them across the development, staging, and production branches:

```bash
# Add changes to the staging area
git add .

# Commit the changes with a descriptive message
git commit -m "Configure BASE URL for integration tests"

# Push changes to the 'dev' branch.
git push origin dev

# Switch to the 'staging' branch, merge changes from 'dev', and push
git checkout staging
git merge dev
git push origin staging

# Switch to the 'main' branch, merge changes from 'staging', and push
git checkout main
git merge staging
git push origin main
```

After executing these commands, all associated pipelines should be triggered once again.

Once the execution of all pipelines is complete, you should observe that all stages have successfully passed.

Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰ You've successfully deployed your very first Lambda function across three distinct stages using Lambda Forge! ðŸš€
